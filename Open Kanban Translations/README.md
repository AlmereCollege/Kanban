## A Global Movement for Open Kanban
Open Kanban aims to reach the world, and to do that we need your help. If you are a native or near-native speaker in any language we welcome you to translate the main document of Open Kanban and place it in this directory.

Use this file format: Open-Kanban-LANGUAGE.md for your translation, also add a translator and language field like is shown on the meta data table on the top of this document.

We request that you use the stable version of the Open Kanban main document, located at the Open Kanban Support Documents [subdirectory](https://github.com/agilelion/Open-Kanban/tree/master/Open%20Kanban%20Support%20Documents) on GitHub. 

Afterwards drop the translated file into the appropriate directory here, there is a folder for every major language, feel free to add new ones. Thanks for your help!
